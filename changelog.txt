02.07.2023  Xiris   - Several large changes requiring find/replace.
        MAJOR
        bot_pull        
            Added argument to not pull per se. Will kill mob where it finds it
            will still return to a camp when done killing. Useful for epic item farms

        xiris_debuffing 
            Added LoS check before attempting to cast, fixed a variable name

        xiris_events_raid_oow_anguish
            Fixed hanvarCaster check (added timer so they don't constantly check debuffs)
            Fixed AMV events that had bad copy pasted code from Hanvar events
            Fixed chkGroupMarkedForDeath to have clr/shm to have their group members run for
            cure and not warp
            Fixed chkMarkedForDeathCureDist having wrong TLO for Target

        xiris_healing   
            **!!!Note: Global find and replace !!!***
            Changed heal points and other vars to be int_point_[group,self,tank]_[normal,frantic,HoT]
            for consistency. See diff for details. 
            Many files referenced these vars including CHARACTER INI FILES!
            Optimized healGRP to use MQ2WorstHurt efficiently
            Changed setHealingSpell to be used consistently and globally
